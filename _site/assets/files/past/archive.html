An <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=97338308#commentBlock">interview</a> with <a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/%7Emejn/">Mark Newman</a> on the newly released <a href="http://www.thamesandhudson.com/en/1/9780500514252.mxs">Atlas of the Real World</a> has been one of the top stories on NPR for a couple of days now. More interesting than the atlas itself (essentially hard-copy <a href="http://www.worldmapper.org/">Worldmapper</a>) is the technique they use to produce their maps. <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/101/20/7499.abstract">This article</a>
provides a concise overview of previous approaches and an introduction
to their diffusion-based method. The algorithm is described first in
terms of macroscopic variables*, but I find this second explanation
especially logical and poetic:<br><blockquote>...one could equally look
at the method as a microscopic diffusion process in which each
individual member of the population performs a Gaussian random walk
about the surface of the map. Over time the population will diffuse
until it is uniform everywhere within the box enclosing the map, except
for statistical fluctuations. The cartogram is derived by moving all
boundaries on the map in such a way that the net flow passing through
them is zero at all times during the diffusion process. This resembles
Dorling’s [cellular automata] method in the sense that different
regions trade their area until a fair distribution is reached. <br><span style="font-style: italic;">Gastner,
MT and Newman, MEJ. Diffusion-based method for producing
density-equalizing maps. Proceedings National Academy of Sciences. USA.
101, 7499–7504 (2004).</span></blockquote> After I first saw
Worldmapper, I tried using an ArcMap script to generate cartograms for
a class project. It was arduously slow, the results were visually
incoherent, and I abandoned the idea. So I'm actually not just feigning
appreciation, promise. <br><br>*<span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">macroscopic equations</span> describe the behavior of a system as determined by the collective and somewhat abstracted behavior of its components </span><br>               whereas <br><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">microscopic equations</span>
handle the most elementary components of a system individually in order
to then compile them into the total representation of behavior</span><br>(or that's what I gathered from a quick read <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=5t0tm0FB1CsC&amp;printsec=toc">here (p.203)</a>, though I'm entirely uncertain about my interpretation!)<br><br>Also not to be missed: <a href="http://journal.fibreculture.org/issue11/issue11_whitelaw.html">Does data art conceptually misconstrue information by hiding the artist's agency in visualization?</a>
It's interesting to consider the aesthetic and editorial choices that
lay behind purportedly transparent representations. Even if you have no
patience for art critique, it's a nice survey of artists working in
this vein.

I took Kate's advice and watched this <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPAO-lZ4_hU&amp;eurl=http://thisisnotapipe.tumblr.com/post/61149756/have-an-hour-you-want-to-fill-with-an?disqus_reply=3971601">YouTube autobiography-of-sorts</a> yesterday. I guess the geographic equivalent might be something like <a href="http://mapserver.gdf-hannover.de/grassusers/map.phtml?winwidth=890&amp;winheight=630&amp;language=1&amp;mapwidth=600&amp;mapheight=400">this</a>?<br>Anyhow, as long as the <a href="http://www.alternet.org/columnists/story/42839/">Geowankers</a>
archive is down, techno-anthropologists are missing a fascinating
Geography identity crisis on the mailing list. These discussions are a
pretty periodic occurrence (e.g. <a href="http://apb.directionsmag.com/archives/3703-Neogeography-is-not-GIS;-not-LI.html">this post</a>).
Sure, many of the same arguments are repeated every time, but it's
engrossing and informative for anyone with a an academic/professional
perspective as nescient (but curious!) as my own. <br>This one began with a call for suggestions on a potential Where2.0 panel (tentatively?) titled <span style="font-style: italic;">Neogeographers meet Paleogeographers</span>.
I copied and pasted all the e-mails into a single document while I made
my nightly Skype calls. I'll post it when the thread dies, but until
then, <a href="http://protogeo.info/aa/GeowankerPaleoNeo_Nov2008.jpg">here's the gist of it</a>.<br>I
left the dates in, because I thought the time-stamp would be nice, but
I guess Wordle doesn't process numbers. I was hoping "2008" would come
out as one of the larger words, with "Nov", "23" and "24" in the mix.
Oh well.<br>Et Voila. <br>Here is the thread, chunked up to satisfy the Google Docs file size limit:<br><a href="http://docs.google.com/Doc?id=ddss7cmk_115hbbffp3f">Part I</a>    <a href="http://docs.google.com/Doc?id=ddss7cmk_114cpgj39g5">Part II</a><br>I also revised the <a href="http://www.wordle.net/gallery/wrdl/346131/NeoPaleoGeowankers">Wordle</a> and figured out how to include the dates by inserting tildes before the numbers.  <a href="http://protogeo.info/aa/GeowankerPaleoNeo_Nov2008.jpg">Or jpeg</a>.

I've been meaning to write a post about my currently favorite D.O.
Valencian product: kakis. I tried kakis last fall and learned not to
eat them until they were incredibly soft, like overripe tomatoes. I
always thought the hard, light orange ones I saw were simply unripe,
but then I saw them advertised as "crujiente," crunchy. So I cut one
open, and braced myself for the astringent chalk-pucker that unripe
kakis supposedly induce. It was nice. More creamy and dense than the
ultra-juicy soft variety. The <a href="http://www.kakifruit.com/">official website</a>
of the regulator confirms that both the hard "persimon" variety and the
soft "classic" variety are covered by the D.O. label. To sum up:<br><a href="http://protogeo.info/aa/images/kaki.png"><img style="display: block; width: 310px; " src="images/kaki.png" alt="" id="kaki" border="0"></a>

<a href="http://www.up2maps.net/#">Up2Maps</a> was just released today. In the vein of <a href="http://maker.geocommons.com/">Maker!</a>,
it aims to offer online geovisualization &amp; publishing. The
interface is pretty clean and intuitive, but I can't say too much about
the functionality as it doesn't appear that the My Maps (this isn't
trademarked?) tab is implemented yet. The <a href="http://sites.up2maps.net/up2maps-docs/Home/help/editor-s-wizard">data input</a>
is designed for thematic mapping, allowing users to attach spreadsheets
to features - either with a "Data Greed"(!) or by manual (yawn) entry. <br>My
tentative kvetch: I don't see how you can use data that others have
input, as it seems each "report" starts with a bare map and that the
only export options are .png images. I hope I'm missing something?<br>Ultimately,
what makes Maker! brilliant is that it's paired with Finder!. Together
they facilitate extremely user-friendly data discovery, access and
reuse...but, in doing so, set a high bar for other applications.

Steven Levitt asked yesterday. Levitt was initially dubious about Nobel
laureate economist Gary Becker's "most addictive good," but now
endorses the expert's judgment and challenges his readers to give it a
stab. Readers' responses fall largely into three main categories:<br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Things people need</span>
- namely oxygen, food, water, sleep. These answers don't distinguish
between "critical" and "addictive," instead opting to uncover a clever,
trick answer from the array of physiological human necessities.<br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Things that are demonstrably addictive</span>
- e.g. gambling, sex, sugar, cigarettes. These range from substances
that are extremely addictive in a physical sense, like heroin, to
addictive behaviors such as shopping. While the medical community will
be perpetually hashing out the scientific validity of these addictions,
I'm inclined to just accept them all as potential contenders. The
problem is that they're highly personal answers - no one would deny
that coffee is <span style="font-style: italic;">addictive</span>, but
it surely isn't the most addictive thing on Earth. I've watched many a
friend struggle desperately with nicotine addiction, for example, but
was myself able to stop smoking cold turkey with nary a craving. (Which
is definitely not to imply that I don't have my own battles, ahem,
Scrabulous...)<br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Outliers </span> -
or everything I am too lazy to categorize. Many of these are abstract
concepts such as happiness, power, and greed. Others are simply quirky
confessions: World of Warcraft, checking myspace, Chik-Fil-A, season 2
of The Office, fivethirtyeight.com. Others are really, really, just
outliers - some funny, some baffling: indoor plumbing, Nobel prizes,
"Easy Access to Information so you don’t have to think [sic]," "utility
maximization," <a href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/11/10/freakonomics-quiz-what-is-the-most-addictive-thing-on-earth/#comment-837817">story</a>, etc.   <br>Admittedly, I was too busy ruling out answers to come up with a good one of my own.  <br>What
surprised me, though maybe it shouldn't have considering the particular
Freakonomics-blog-audience, was the number of people who said
information/access to information/instant information. I would hardly
try to convince anyone that this is the most addictive thing on Earth,
but it's definitely a weakness I relate to at the moment.

I promised myself today I'd get back to work on my thesis, but I really couldn't let the launch of <a href="http://change.gov/">change.gov</a>
go by unacknowledged. It's no news that Obama's campaign has been
extremely tech savy - incredibly productive social networking,
outrageous amounts of online donations, <a href="http://campaignstops.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/10/09/whats-in-a-web-site/"> crisp design and usability</a> - even <a href="http://gislounge.com/gis-volunteers-for-obama/">GIS for change</a>(<a href="http://apb.directionsmag.com/archives/5017-Obamas-Houdini-Computer-Making-Non-voters-Disappear.html">whoa!</a>).  <br>A stark contrast to McCain, who claims he has "<a href="http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2008/08/13/john_mccain_technology/">never felt the particular need to email</a>."  <br>Yet
even if you saw it coming, it's pretty cool that change.gov is already
deployed. From first glance, it's notable that they are <a href="http://www.change.gov/page/s/yourvision">soliciting input</a>, articulating their agenda, and <a href="http://www.change.gov/page/s/application">hiring</a>.
Sure, it feels a bit gratuitous and thus far lacks much substance. The
GSA Transition link that appears on every page, for instance, directs
to an off-site tangle of PDF files, many of which don't really seem to
reflect any sort of transition and simply list posts from the current
administration. <br>Still, an federal administration that harnesses the power of the net-roots is a pretty awesome prospect.

We 80's babies have always known Texas as mound of electoral votes
automatically handed to the GOP, but it was not always so. Texas was
once a bastion of blue, part of the "<a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/2004/0714/p01s03-usgn.htm">Solid South</a>." (Here's your <a href="http://www.270towin.com/">historical election map</a> carto-refresher.) <br>Come 2004, however, we all knew Texas would go red. <br>I
have a vivid recollection of that election night: About 70 people in
our house, tons of vegetarian Tex-Mex snacks, a keg of Real Ale
supplemented by a fridge full of Lone Star - we even brought out the TV
for the occasion...It's painful to remember how confidently we were
expecting to celebrate the toss out of you-know-who. As the night wore
on and the whole disaster unfolded, I kept catching flashes of the
Texas map on the news. There it was, my first vote in a presidential
campaign, stranded on the little blue island of Travis county amidst a
hopeless wash of crimson. <br>Obviously, I learned my lesson and re-registered in NM this time around. <br>Nonetheless, it warms my heart to see the Texas county map this year.  <br>

<br>Besides
scoring a bluer frontera, Obama also reigned in Dallas, Houston, and
San Antonio. Even Clinton, who also mustered 43.8% in '96, missed the
metros.

<h6>Friday, October 31, 2008</h6>
My father always told me, "<a href="http://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=0001yB&amp;topic_id=1">Absolute power corrupts, absolute PowerPoint corrupts absolutely</a>."
Hypocritically, of course, since he is a veteran Keynote user himself.
I have a vivid recollection of sitting in on some sort of investors
meeting where my father closed his presentation with a clip of the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJOuoyoMhj8">Globe scene from the Great Dictator</a>.  Did I mention he replaced the audio with <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9HnoRgRIwg&amp;feature=related">Cantaloop</a>
and started dancing "funky" along with a couple of his board members?
I'm sure I found it mortifying at the time, but I appreciate his little
mash-up in retrospect. And am sure everyone else in the audience...Well
I'm sure they didn't fall asleep. <br>Unfortunately, this past year I've seen a lot of slides like <a href="http://www4.uji.es/%7Eal107673/GRIM.png">this</a>, slides that I would go so far as to say <span style="font-style: italic;">harm</span>
their cause. Doesn't interoperability look like a nightmare? Piles of
clip art do not exactly make a nice visual metaphor for standard-driven
data overlays. <br>Which is a perfect segue into announcing the best presentation I've seen in a long time: Dave Bouwman's <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/dbouwman/usability-in-the-geoweb-presentation?type=powerpoint"><span style="font-style: italic;">Usability in the Geoweb</span></a>
presentation from the Texas GIS Forum. The presentation communicates a
concise, convincing argument with smart, humorous, clean design. Sadly,
this is the third year in a row that I have missed the forum. It's
organized by <a href="http://forum.tnris.org/">TNRIS</a>, my former
employer, and while I suppose I could derive consolation from my
various editions of GIS Forum totes and water bottles, I'm still a
little envious...<br>On the other hand, I <span style="font-style: italic;">was</span> able to watch Andrew Turner's excellent <a href="http://highearthorbit.com/oreilly-webcast-trends-and-technologies-in-where-20/">webcast</a> last week.  They said they'd be posting the video, but until then, <a href="http://www.viddler.com/explore/carsonified/videos/52/">this</a> should tide you over. Both presentations prompted me to check back in on <a href="http://www.geocommons.com/">geocommons</a>.
I had played around with Finder when it was first released, but didn't
realize how much it has developed. And Maker really seems to be a
worthy model of the kind of applications Mr. Bouwman appeals for. <br>All this inspired me to upload some of my old presentations to Slideshare:<br>My <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/amenitya/embedded-neon-presentation/">undergraduate thesis</a> from UT.  Brace yourself.  My awesome professor, <a href="http://www.utexas.edu/cola/depts/geography/faculty/profiles/zonn/leo/">Dr. Leo Zonn</a>,
specializes in the geography of cinema. After a grueling semester of
intensive remote sensing and advanced GIS, I was absolutely reveling in
cultural theory. My take on it was little overboard maybe, but fun.
Makes me miss Wheatsville. <br><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/amenitya/the-bauhaus-presentation/">Some</a> <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/amenitya/george-nelson-presentation/">presentations</a> <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/amenitya/adolf-loos-presentation/">that</a> <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/amenitya/isamu-noguchi-presentation/">I</a> <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/amenitya/andree-putman-presentation/">made</a>
for a history of interior design class I took with an extra credit that
same spring. These bring back especially fond memories since I was very
outnumbered by a swarm of Dallas/ Houston-bred Shopping- er, "Interior
Design" majors. We seriously took a <span style="font-style: italic;">field trip</span> to Design Within Reach.  <br>And some presentations from my past semester in Münster: Two on <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/amenitya/qualitative-spatial-reasoning-cardinal-directions-as-an-example-presentation/">spatial</a> <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/amenitya/using-orientation-information-for-qualitative-spatial-reasoning-presentation/">cognition</a>.  A <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/amenitya/usability-study-mouse-zoom-presentation/">usability</a> study.  And a <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/amenitya/maps-on-context-adaptive-digital-signage-presentation/">requirements analysis</a>
for context adaptive digital signage (which was miserable to perform -
imagine me recording interviews about maps with German pedestrians). <br>Slideshare
is awesome. I kind of doubt there is much of an audience for any of
these, but who knows. They're much more useful there than simply saved
to a CD.<br clear="all">

<h6>Wednesday, October 29, 2008</h6>
I know it might appear that the election is distracting me...but I <span style="font-style: italic;">am</span>
hard at work. It's just that I'm trying a new approach to my whole
implementation, and developing locally - so there's not much to show
yet.<br>After my professor suggested putting more emphasis on the
consumer/tourist/chef end of the idea, I started to wonder if I wasn't
going to need a CMS to manage accounts, ratings, comments, and
user-contributed recipes. I spent a couple days trying to convince
myself I could learn Drupal (someday, not now) before considering
Wordpress. It's hardly a blogs-only platform - in fact many designers
use it to create more traditional websites so that their clients can
largely manage content themselves. Sounds ideal, since, in theory, I
would want to pass off authorship of the project to the regulatory
committees that certify products. <br>I spent several days sorting through all the Google Maps plug-ins, finally settling on <a href="http://code.google.com/p/wordpress-geo-mashup/">Wordpress Geomashup</a>.  It seems to be the most flexible and is very well documented. (Bonus points because the developer <a href="http://www.cyberhobo.net/hobomap/">maps his biking and hiking</a> from Santa Fe.) This <a href="http://www.bioneural.net/2008/09/21/geo-mashup-implementation-guide/">implementation guide</a> is also highly recommended.  <br>I'm
still not positive about the whole set up, but it does look promising.
With the shifted emphasis, the end user will probably be a cook rather
than a farmer. Consequently, the name "Farm2.0" is really misleading.
I'll try to come up with something equally hokey to replace it.

I would love to see this exhibit in person.  <br>I especially love <a href="http://rachellecohen.com/">Rachelle Cohen's</a>
two "condensed" watercolors of conglomerate nations. She's produced by
them by arranging geometries of the statistically happiest and greenest
countries. <br>With the whole <a href="http://andreavanderkooij.com/works/emb_som.php">unexpected</a>-<a href="http://www.hammergallery.com/Artists/Cogan,%20Orly/Cogan.htm">embroidery</a>-<a href="http://www.davidwillburn.com/HereForAReason.html">themes</a> <a href="http://www.jennyhart.net/">movement</a>, you had to guess it was only a matter of time before someone did this:<br>

<br>But its great nonetheless, right? (In all fairness note that the piece is from 2005 when ironic crafting wasn't yet so trendy.) <br>Actually, the <a href="http://www.brooklynartscouncil.org/documents/1034">whole show</a> looks interesting.

<span style="font-family: Gill Sans,sans-serif; font-size: 18px;">Up until this summer, I had an almost hysterical dedication to Gill Sans.</span> <span style="font-family: Gill Sans,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;">
Working on collaborative projects involving lots of back and forth
document trading, it would pain me to use another typeface for my
non-Mac partners. I usually settled for Trebuchet to ensure they
wouldn't receive garbled dingbats. Sometimes I offered to complete
assignments I had already spent more than my share of time on just so I
could have the satisfaction of looking at the final printed product in
my favorite font. <br>For essays, of course, I grudgingly accepted the
12pt Times New Roman mandate. But on technical reports, cartography
assignments, resumes, and powerpoints, I rarely deviated from Gill
Sans. And when I look back at that work it does look nice, for it <span style="font-style: italic;">is</span> a beautiful, <a href="http://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=00009r&amp;topic_id=1">Tufte-approved</a> typeface. <br>But Germany changed me.  I began to appreciate sparse, <a href="http://www.ironicsans.com/owmyeyes/">black on white</a> presentations, and acclimate to ragged-edged alignment.  I finally got my hands on <a href="http://www.helveticafilm.com/">the documentary</a>
I had sought since catching a preview at MOMA last summer. Swept up in
the lore of Helvetica, I decided to take the plunge. I opened my
farm2.0 logo, took a deep breath, and descended my font menu. I think I
even winced as I passed Gill Sans.</span>  <br><br><span style="font-family: Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 18px;"> Helvetica looked okay. </span><br><br><span style="font-family: HelveticaNeue,Helvetica-Neue,Helvetica Neue,Helvetica; font-size: 18px;"> Helvetica-Neue looked great.  <br></span><br><span style="font-family: HelveticaNeue-Light,Helvetica Neue Light,Helvetica Neue,Helvetica; font-weight: 300; font-size: 18px;"> And Helvetica Neue Light looked phenomenal. Goodbye Gill. </span><br><br><span style="font-family: HelveticaNeue-Light,Helvetica Neue Light,Helvetica Neue,Helvetica; font-weight: 300; font-size: 14px;">Unfortunately, coordinating the CSS to be <a href="http://blog.gesteves.com/post/36097597/helvetica-neue-light">consistent between browsers and platforms</a>
is really going to require some flexibility. Helvetica Neue won't show
up on Windows, as far as I can tell - but maybe Helvetica with weight
adjustments can approximate it? Furthermore, having just gotten this
site up, I'm starting to consider that I may have taken it all too far.
Helvetica Neue is <a href="http://www4.uji.es/%7Eal107673/acerca.html">dizzying in large blocks of text</a>, isn't it?  Should I introduce a complementary sans-serif?  Would normal Helvetica be preferable?  <br>Or maybe I should just GET ON WITH IT and work on my literature review.  ;) </span>

I was just reading <a href="http://geog.tamu.edu/%7Esui/publications/GISasMedia.pdf">an argument by Goodchild &amp; Sui</a>
that GIS now (or then, 2001) should be considered a form of media being
that its ultimate goal is to communicate. The perspective fits well
with my recent approach to my thesis, so I skimmed the document for
juicy propositions. Then I came across:<blockquote>Indeed, with the
emergence of digital places and digital individuals (Curry 1998), we
are witnessing not only Arnold Toynbee ’s etherization of history but
also the <span style="font-style: italic;">etherization of geography</span>. </blockquote>The
phrase has an interesting tone, so I Googled it to see if it had by any
chance sparked a flurry of citations. My findings were pretty thin -
this didn't seem to be another "citizens as sensors" moment for
Goodchild, and original texts by Toynbee weren't coming up. I was just
about to move on when - "etherealize toynbee" (the geographers seem to
have transposed some letters) brought up <a href="http://www.home.earthlink.net/%7Eacorioso/conceptualizing3a.htm">this</a>.
Apparently Buckminster Fuller used the phrase "ephemeralization," and
Mr. Fowler associates this with Bucky's iconic tensegrity spheres,
"more easily caught with ever more ethereal than ever more transient
forms." Hm. It really is quite a poetic piece of correspondence - but
if it hadn't been CCed to my grandfather, I'm not sure I would have
been curious enough to read the whole thing. But it was, and I did -
thus uncovering this gem:<blockquote>I've no doubt that it seems as
if I'm chewing these jerkied terms over an [sic] over forever, getting
no juice out other than my own saliva. But that's what needs
doing.Moistening up dried and hardened (or, on the other hand, new)
terms, getting teeth in between the fibers, forcing them apart and
sensing Universe among them.</blockquote>Whoa.
